This project has been adapted from the SnorkelAI repository on GitHub, where I perform a weak supervision of chest radiographs. Here, I use the Snorkel Labeling functions to give the 
radiographs a label, 1 or 2 based on the radiographers notes and and run it on a ResNet model to detect the abnormal chest radiographs by the notes provided. I had to make a lot of changes
to the codes and the dependencies in the Snorkel Metal repository that I downloaded. The Snorkel Metal library is used for visualization of the data. In the repostory is also my report of 
my project.
